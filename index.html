            I'm Vanessa. I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in April 2019. I majored in Computer Engineering (and minored in Studio Arts, as well as got a certificate in American Sign Language). After that, I contributed to conservation efforts in Alaska and Mammoth Cave NP with the Student Conservation Association and AmeriCorps. In quarantine times, I have been working on developing a game as well as studying online animation resources (especially through Open Animation).</p>
		<p>
            I am currently seeking fulltime employment.</p>
